This project is a Blog website created with CSS for design, Express.js, EJS templating, and JavaScript.The JavaScript library "axios" is used to make HTTP requests from the browser. 
There are two servers: one listens on port 3000 for requests, and the other requests via API on port 4000. Both the servers should operate on separate terminals.
